Since healthcare data is confidential and should not fall into the wrong hands,it is a moral obligation to not let this data fall into the wrong hands. A private blockchain network will be built. This is done because private blockchain operators can control who is allowed to operate a node, as well as how those nodes are connected. A node that restricts the transmission of information, or transmits incorrect information, must be identifiable and circumventable to maintain the integrity of the system.[4] To tackle these ethical issues, while testing the system, it will be communicated with the participants that only with their consent will their data be monitored (anonymized data) and they can back out AT ANY GIVEN TIME. It is my responsibility as a professional to delete all data gathered for the project upon its completion
